Zoonomia
========

Zoonomia is a small library for strongly-typed genetic programming. It is
currently early in the planning stages, so things like usage examples,
benchmarks, and a bibliography are absent for now. This page will just be a
collection of API docs until the library has stabilized enough that it makes
sense to document it further.
